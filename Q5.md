<!-- Sorting an array using a custom sorting algorithm. For the purpose of this demonstration, let's choose to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm. We'll solve this problem using JavaScript. Do not use the built-in `sort()` method.

Example
Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]
Output: [2, 7, 9, 12] -->

**Clarifying questions:**
1) Can I assume the input will always be an array of numbers?
2) How should I handle an empty array as input?
3) Should the sort be in ascending order?

**Pseudo-coding:**
```
**Function**: Sort an array using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

**Input**: An array named `arr`.

**Steps**:

1. For each pass, starting from the first element up to the second-to-last element of the array:
    a. Initialize a boolean variable `swapped` to `false`. This will track if any elements were swapped during this pass.
    
    b. For each element in the array, starting from the first element up to the `length of array - current pass number - 1`:
        i. Compare the current element with the next one.
        ii. If the current element is greater than the next one:
            - Store the current element in a temporary variable `temp`.
            - Assign the value of the next element to the current element.
            - Assign the value of `temp` to the next element.
            - Set `swapped` to `true` indicating that a swap occurred.
    
    c. After the inner loop, check the value of `swapped`.
        i. If `swapped` is `false`, this means no swaps were made during this pass, indicating that the array is already sorted. In this case, break out of the outer loop.

2. Return the sorted `arr`.

This pseudocode provides a step-by-step breakdown of the Bubble Sort algorithm, capturing the logic of the JavaScript function in a language-agnostic manner.
```

**Iterative solution:**
```javascript
function bubbleSort(arr) {

    // Outer loop to control the number of passes
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
        // Variable to check if any swaps occurred in this pass
        let swapped = false;

        // Inner loop to perform the actual comparisons and swaps
        for (let j = 0; j < arr.length - i - 1; j++) {
            // Compare current element with the next one
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                let temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = temp;

                swapped = true;
            }
        }

        // If no two elements were swapped by inner loop, then the array is sorted
        if (!swapped) {
            break;
        }
    }

    return arr;
}

```

**Explanation:**
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated for each element until no more swaps are needed, which means the array is sorted. It's called "Bubble Sort" because the smallest elements "bubble" to the top of the array, while the largest elements "sink" to the bottom. Note that while Bubble Sort is simple and intuitive, it's not the most efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets.
