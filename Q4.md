<!-- Determine if all characters in a given string are unique without using array methods or converting the string to an array. We'll solve this problem using JavaScript. -->

**Clarifying questions:**
1) Can I assume that the input string will always be non-empty?
2) Are the characters case-sensitive? (e.g., is 'A' considered different from 'a'?)

**Pseudocode:**
```
Function: Check if all characters in a given string are unique.

Input: A string named str.

Steps:

For each character in the string, referenced by index i:
a. For each subsequent character in the string after the character at index i, referenced by index j:
i. Compare the character at index i with the character at index j.
ii. If the two characters are the same, return false (indicating the string has duplicate characters).
If no duplicates are found after all comparisons, return true (indicating all characters in the string are unique).
```

**Solution:**
```javascript
function hasUniqueCharacters(str) {
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < str.length; j++) {
            if (str[i] === str[j]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

**Explanation:**
The function works by comparing each character in the string with every other character that comes after it. If at any point it finds two characters that are the same, it returns false indicating the string does not have unique characters. If no such characters are found after checking all possible pairs, the function returns true indicating the string has all unique characters.
